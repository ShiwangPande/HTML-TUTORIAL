            HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not
            officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML
            4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.
          </p>
          <img class="history__img" src="./img/struce antony.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with
            various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and
            specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user
            to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make
            sites very efficient.
          </p>

            <li>
              HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and
              accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the
              language was also not growing.

            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>
              Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few
              additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until
              January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>
              Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved
              new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But
              these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
            </li>
            <hr>
            <p>
              <li>
                Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which
                is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which
                was published in the year 2012.
