        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first official version of CSS, called CSS1.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS1 was initially supported by only a few web browsers, including Internet Explorer 3 and Netscape Navigator 4.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS2 was released in 1998, introducing new features such as positioning, text effects, and a wide range of selectors.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its popularity among web designers, CSS2 took several years to become widely adopted by web browsers.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS3 was introduced in 1999 and included new features such as animations, transitions, and multiple background images.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-2000s, web designers started using CSS frameworks to simplify the development process and improve cross-browser compatibility.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; With the advent of responsive web design in the early 2010s, CSS became increasingly important for creating flexible, mobile-friendly layouts.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less have gained popularity, offering advanced features like variables, mixins, and functions.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS continues to evolve, with new features like CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox offering even more powerful layout options for web designers.</li>

      <h4><span class="fa fa-edit"></span>&starf; CSS1 History</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  CSS1 was first released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in December 1996.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was designed to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, allowing for greater flexibility and control over page layout.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS1 included a limited set of selectors and properties for controlling font size, color, background, and text alignment.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; It also introduced the concept of a "box model," allowing designers to specify the size and positioning of page elements.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS1 was initially supported by only a few web browsers, including Internet Explorer 3 and Netscape Navigator 4.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its limitations, CSS1 laid the foundation for the future development of CSS, paving the way for more advanced layout and styling options in later versions.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4><span class="fa fa-edit"></span>&starf; CSS2 History</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  CSS2 was introduced in 1998 as the second version of Cascading Style Sheets.

        </li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS2 introduced many new features to CSS, including positioning, text effects, and a wide range of selectors</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a significant improvement over CSS1, introducing a wider range of selectors, positioning options, and other features.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS2 added support for media-specific stylesheets, allowing developers to specify styles for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;The standardization of CSS2 took several years, with the final recommendation not released until 2004.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, web browsers began to implement various parts of CSS2, leading to inconsistent support across different browsers.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these challenges, CSS2 became a popular tool for web designers, allowing them to create more complex and sophisticated designs.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the key features introduced in CSS2 include absolute and relative positioning, z-index, background properties, and more advanced typography options.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS2 also included support for internationalization and accessibility, making it easier for designers to create websites that could be accessed by people around the world.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; While CSS2 has been largely replaced by newer versions of CSS, it remains an important part of the history of web design and a foundational technology for modern websites.</li>

      <h4><span class="fa fa-edit"></span>&starf; CSS2 History</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS3 was first proposed in 1999 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organization responsible for developing web standards.
        </li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was intended to be the next major version of CSS, following CSS2.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; CSS3 was designed to include a wide range of new features, such as advanced selectors, animations, and 3D transformations.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; The development of CSS3 took several years, with different modules being released at different times.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;The first CSS3 module to be released was the Selectors module in 2001, which introduced new selector types like attribute selectors and pseudo-elements.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Other notable CSS3 modules include the Box Model module, the Backgrounds and Borders module, and the Animations module.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; The release of CSS3 modules was often accompanied by a slow adoption by web browsers, with some features taking years to become widely supported.</li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these challenges, CSS3 has become an essential tool for web designers, offering a wide range of advanced layout and styling options.        </li>
        <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, newer CSS modules like Flexbox and Grid Layout have further expanded the capabilities of CSS for creating complex, responsive layouts.</li>
